    <main><h1>Circular and miscellaneous walks thence and possibly thither</h1><!-- l. 8 --><p class="noindent">I have found the following to be feasible; in determining the applicability of thatdatum, it may be noted that I am not particularly athletic, although walking is notterribly strenuous since I am not particularly big.</p><!-- l. 10 --><p class="indent">   About four or five miles: from central Oxford to the towpath, turn away fromPort Meadow towards University Parks, thence down Mesopotamia and through theverge of Cowley back to the High Street.</p><!-- l. 12 --><p class="indent">   A reasonable approximation of a half marathon proceeds from the High Streetdown St Aldate&#8217;s to the river, turns right and follows the river before followingCastle Mill Stream and the canal path until Godstow; turn left to the Isis, and followit until the path finally meets Wytham woods, before following the Green Belt Wayin a loop back to the Thames path; follow that southwards opposite Port Meadow,and through Osney, before breaking off at St Aldate&#8217;s again, and returning to thecity centre (perhaps the High Street). The path is not very well-maintained beyondPort Meadow.</p><!-- l. 14 --><p class="indent">   About nine miles: down the towpath to Port Meadow, following the foot of whichone reaches the Thames Path&#8212;continue to Wolvercote, turn right through the urbanfringe and along the A40 briefly before a rather obscure turn leads to the Cherwell,leading eventually to University Parks and a choice of Mesopotamia or a more directroute.</p><!-- l. 16 --><p class="indent">   About twenty-five miles: as above to the Thames Path, which should be followeduntil Farmoor Reservoir, whence Cumnor, I think Boars Hill and Kennington, andthen back down the Thames to central Oxford.</p><!-- l. 18 --><p class="indent">   About forty miles: down the Thames Path to Reading, with a stop at a pub forlunch; take the train back from the station.</p>   <h2>&#192; propos.</h2><h3>&#201;tiquettes.</h3><p><a href="../etiquettes/walks.html">walks<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/oxford.html">Oxford<span class="nowidth">.</span></a></p><h3>Mises &#224; jour.</h3><p>J.P.
