    <main><h1>A chicken stew.</h1><!-- l. 7 --><p class="noindent">Some years ago, <a id="x1-2"/><a id="page.3"/><a href="chicken.html#X0-ottolenghi2017"><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Ottolenghi</span></a> published three recipes for slow-cooked chicken in TheGuardian. My mother and I have revised the second.</p><!-- l. 9 --><p class="indent">   The ingredients we use are nearly entirely the same, except that we usually forgetthe bay leaves, often use more chicken, and sometimes use different pasta. At somepoint we started to add celery, which I think is a good choice. There is thereforemuch more vegetable in the broth than in Ottolenghi&#8217;s variant. I am often lazy anduse frozen sofrito; about 750&#8211;1000 grammes of it for 1.5 kg of chicken works fordinner party catering.</p>     <ol class="enumerate1"><li class="enumerate" id="x1-4x1">Warm a large dutch or casserole on the stove or in the oven.</li><li class="enumerate" id="x1-6x2">Soften first the garlic, anchovies, shallots, and onions (unless the latter areto come from frozen sofrito) in the stove, and then celery and carrot (orfrozen sofrito if using). I have obtained the best results by softening themin the oven at about 110C for half an hour, browning the base slightly;the vegetables should be introduced at the earliest after five minutes or soof softening, and preferably later. The herbs should also be thrown in atthis point.</li><li class="enumerate" id="x1-8x3">Put the vegetable stock in, and then the chicken. Leave in the oven fortwo or three hours.</li><li class="enumerate" id="x1-10x4">Some of the chicken will have browned because it was exposed. Removeall the chicken, and return the chicken that hasn&#8217;t been browned into theoven on a separate tray.</li><li class="enumerate" id="x1-12x5">At the same time, reduce the sauce (without the chicken) either in theoven or the stove.</li><li class="enumerate" id="x1-14x6">When serving with pasta, ladle some of the sauce out of the casserole andinto the pasta to mix, and mix with the rocket.</li></ol><!-- l. 19 --><p class="indent">   The principal difference from Ottolenghi&#8217;s recipe is that the chicken is browned inthe oven rather than seared.</p>   <dl class="thebibliography"><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-ottolenghi2017"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-1">   <!-- l. 20 --><p class="noindent"><a id="page.4"/><a href="chicken.html" id="X0-"/><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Ottolenghi</span>, Yotam<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/04/slow-cooked-chicken-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-pasta-braised-celeriac-stew">, &#8216;Yotam Ottolenghi&#8217;s slow-cooked chicken recipes&#8217;<span class="nowidth">,</span></a><span class="ec-lmri-10">The Guardian, Food </span>(4th&#160;Feb. 2017).</p></dd></dl><h2>&#192; propos.</h2><h3>&#201;tiquettes.</h3><p><a href="../etiquettes/recettes.html">recettes<span class="nowidth">.</span></a></p><h3>Mises &#224; jour.</h3><p>J.P.
