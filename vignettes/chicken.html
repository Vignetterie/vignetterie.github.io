                <h1>A chicken stew.</h1>

<!-- l. 7 --><p class='noindent'>Some years ago, <a id='x1-2'></a><a id='page.2'></a><a href='chicken.html#X0-ottolenghi2017'><span class='ec-lmcsc-10'>Ottolenghi</span></a> published three recipes for slow-cooked chicken in The
Guardian. My mother and I have revised the second.
</p><!-- l. 9 --><p class='indent'>   The ingredients we use are nearly entirely the same, except that we usually forget
the bay leaves, often use more chicken, and sometimes use different pasta. At some
point we started to add celery, which I think is a good choice. There is therefore



much more vegetable in the broth than in Ottolenghi’s variant. I am often lazy and
use frozen sofrito; about 750–1000 grammes of it for 1.5 kg of chicken works for
dinner party catering.
</p>     
<ol class='enumerate1'>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-4x1'>Warm a large dutch or casserole on the stove or in the oven.
</li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-6x2'>Soften first the garlic, anchovies, shallots, and onions (unless the latter are
to come from frozen sofrito) in the stove, and then celery and carrot (or
frozen sofrito if using). I have obtained the best results by softening them
in the oven at about 110C for half an hour, browning the base slightly;
the vegetables should be introduced at the earliest after five minutes or so
of softening, and preferably later. The herbs should also be thrown in at
this point.
</li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-8x3'>Put the vegetable stock in, and then the chicken. Leave in the oven for
two or three hours.
</li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-10x4'>Some of the chicken will have browned because it was exposed. Remove
all the chicken, and return the chicken that hasn’t been browned into the
oven on a separate tray.
</li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-12x5'>At the same time, reduce the sauce (without the chicken) either in the
oven or the stove.
</li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x1-14x6'>When serving with pasta, ladle some of the sauce out of the casserole and
into the pasta to mix, and mix with the rocket.</li></ol>
<!-- l. 19 --><p class='indent'>   The principal difference from Ottolenghi’s recipe is that the chicken is browned in
the oven rather than seared.
