<h1>A chicken stew.</h1>
<!-- l. 7 --><p class="noindent">Some years ago, <a id="x1-2"></a><a id="page.3"></a><a href="chicken.html#X0-ottolenghi2017"><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Ottolenghi</span></a> published three recipes for slow-cooked chicken in The
Guardian. My mother and I have revised the second.
</p><!-- l. 9 --><p class="indent">   The ingredients we use are nearly entirely the same, except that we usually forget
the bay leaves, often use more chicken, and sometimes use different pasta. At some
point we started to add celery, which I think is a good choice. There is therefore
much more vegetable in the broth than in Ottolenghi’s variant. I am often lazy and
use frozen sofrito; about 750–1000 grammes of it for 1.5 kg of chicken works for
dinner party catering.

<ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4x1">Warm a large casserole on the stove or in the oven.
</li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-6x2">Soften first the garlic, anchovies, shallots, and onions (unless the latter are
to come from frozen sofrito) in the stove, and then celery and carrot (or
frozen sofrito if using). I have obtained the best results by softening them
in the oven at about 110C for half an hour, browning the base slightly;
the vegetables should be introduced at the earliest after five minutes or so
of softening, and preferably later.
</li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-8x3">Pour in the vegetable stock, the herbs, and then the chicken. Leave for a
suitable period (a note on timing follows).</li></ol>
<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="timing"><span class="titlemark">0.1   </span> <a id="x1-10000.1"></a>Timing.</h4>
<!-- l. 17 --><p class="noindent"></p>
<ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-1002x1">I have with success left this recipe in the oven at  120C (fan) for about
eight hours, taking the lid off maybe an hour before serving to slightly
speed the reduction of the sauce. The chicken will brown after long enough,
and is pleasantly tender.
</li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-1004x2">There  are  some  subtleties  here:  chicken  not  near  the  surface  will  not
brown. This can be fixed by removing the chicken, which is particularly
convenient  e.g.  if  cooking  for  a  small  gathering  with  the  intention  of
retaining substantial leftovers.
</li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-1006x3">Given less time, one can leave the lid off. One of course then has to check
when the sauce is too evaporated, avoid burning, and so on.
</li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-1008x4">The shortest I have left this recipe in the oven is about two hours, at 160C.</li></ol>
<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="serving"><span class="titlemark">0.2   </span> <a id="x1-20000.2"></a>Serving.</h4>
<!-- l. 25 --><p class="noindent">Flatbread or pasta (the original suggestion is tagliatelle) go well.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="leftovers"><span class="titlemark">0.3   </span> <a id="x1-30000.3"></a>Leftovers.</h4>
<!-- l. 28 --><p class="noindent">This keeps as long as any other chicken dish will keep in the fridge. It can also be
frozen and microwaved relatively profitably.
