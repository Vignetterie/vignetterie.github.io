<h1>Are those eggs in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?</h1>

<!-- l. 8 --><p class="noindent">I hoped to write a profile on this intriguing new parliamentarian —
but when her responses came back, I realised it was a non-starter.
</p>
<!-- l. 10 --><p class="noindent">This was because the nature of her answers, due mainly to the language
barrier, would have exposed her to — I felt — unjustified public derision.
To give one relatively tame example, I asked her about the inclusion of
her name on the list of MP members called to appear before the
ANC’s Integrity Commission in 2020. This was Havard’s written
response:
</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<!-- l. 12 --><p class="noindent">One day I found a list of 23 people was published for the
Integrity  Commission,  also  with  my  name  there.  I  was
so  excited  at  that  time.  I  did  not  understand  what  is
the Integrity Commission’s role? Just saw my name was
mentioned with many famous leaders. I also felt lucky to
get a free Advertisement with so many respect high profile
leaders, I had waited for over 2-3 weeks for appearance
in front of the Integrity Commission. I also phoned the
Integrity Commission if I need to appear in the Integrity
Commission? The answer is no, I do not need to appear at
the Integrity Commission, because I had passed Vetting.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">
<!-- l. 16 --><p class="noindent">The  rest  of  the  responses  were  even  more  surreal,  and  included
an anecdote about Havard’s late husband never leaving the house
without filling his pockets with boiled eggs to distribute to the poor.</p></blockquote>
