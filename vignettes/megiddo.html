<blockquote class="quote">
<!-- l. 9 --><p class="noindent">Yuval Lotem, a 45-year old filmmaker and father of one, lives in
Kfar Shmaryahu, an affluent town north of Tel Aviv. …Yuval has
refused to serve in Israeli-occupied territory many times. Twice, he
has been imprisoned for doing so. …During the first Intifada, Yuval
refused to serve in Gaza, and he was finally sentenced to 28 days
in a military prison. Several years later, he refused a tour of duty
in the Megiddo prison. Though Megiddo is inside the Green Line,
Yuval did not feel he could serve because Palestinian administrative
detainees were held there. Again, he found himself sentenced to 28
days in the brig.
</p>
<!-- l. 11 --><p class="noindent">Upon his release from military lockup in July 1997, Yuval Lotem
received a letter from Megiddo Prison. It was written, in English, by
an administrative detainee. The script was so small that it had to
be magnified in order to be deciphered:
</p>
<!-- l. 13 --><p class="noindent"><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">a letter to an anonymous soldier</span>
</p>
<!-- l. 15 --><p class="noindent">A small item in the <span class="ec-lmri-10">Al-Quds </span>newspaper dated July 8, 1997 read:
‘Israeli soldier who refused to serve in Megiddo Prison sentenced
to military lockup.’ The item, which totaled eight lines, reported
that an officer with the rank of lieutenant said: ‘I prefer to to be
a prisoner in jail than the jailer of political prisoners incarcerated
without a trial.’
</p>
<!-- l. 17 --><p class="noindent">Who are you?
</p>
<!-- l. 19 --><p class="noindent">Who are you, officer?
</p>
<!-- l. 21 --><p class="noindent">I want to write to you, but first I need to know who you are. I need
to know what motivated you to do what you did. I need to know
how you arrived at this principled, conscientious decision. How is it
that you opted to rebel in this most unique, unexpected way?
</p>
<!-- l. 23 --><p class="noindent">Who are you?</p>
<!-- l. 25 --><p class="noindent">What’s your name? Where do you live? What do you do? How old
are you? Do you have children? Do you love the sea/ What books
do you read? And what are you doing this very moment in the cell
in which you are imprisoned? Do you have enough cigarettes? Does
anyone there identify with you? Are you asking yourself, ‘Was it
worth it?’ What feelings fill your soul, trapped between the bare
walls closing in around you? Do I know you? Have we ever met? Can
you see the moon and the stars from your cell window? Have your
ears adjusted to the clanging of heavy keys, the screeching of locks,
the banging of metal doors? What did they tell you in your court
martial, and what did you reply?
</p>
<!-- l. 27 --><p class="noindent">Do you see fields of wheat and oat swaying in the wind in your sleep?
Do you see plains of sunflowers that feast your eyes with shades of
yellow, green, and black, and the sun tans you, and you smile in your
sleep, and the walls come tumbling down, and an anonymous man
waves to you from afar?
</p>
<!-- l. 29 --><p class="noindent">Who are you, lieutenant?
</p>
<!-- l. 31 --><p class="noindent">Why  do  you  attribute  so  much  importance  to  the  issue  of
administrative detainees?
</p>
<!-- l. 33 --><p class="noindent">Do you really hold my freedom so dear?
</p>
<!-- l. 35 --><p class="noindent">Would the role of jailer have broken you? Just a week, or two, or
three at the most, and you would have finished your reserve duty,
and returned to your civilian life.
</p>
<!-- l. 37 --><p class="noindent">Indeed, you could have kept silent, conquered your anger, kept your
feelings  to  yourself.  You  could  have  been  a  polite  jailer,  treated
the detainees with courtesy, and been humane? What would have
happened to you had you done so?
</p>
<!-- l. 39 --><p class="noindent">So who are you?
</p>
<!-- l. 41 --><p class="noindent">How do the wardens treat you? Does your wife visit you, maybe your
girlfriend, your mother, or your children? Do you write letters? To
whom? How do you begin a letter to a woman you love? Do you think
about me? What does my freedom to you? What, in your eyes, is
the meaning of freedom in general? Isn’t ‘sate security’ important
to you? And what if I’m a real terrorist? What would you say then?
</p>
<!-- l. 43 --><p class="noindent">Aren’t you regretful? Didn’t some doubt creep in when they said,
‘They’re dangerous, they belong to Hamas, to Islamic Jihad, to the
Popular Front? Don’t you trust our security services? Do you really
think we’d throw innocent people into jail?’
</p>
<!-- l. 45 --><p class="noindent">So who are you?
</p>
<!-- l. 47 --><p class="noindent">Are you asleep now? Or are you lying on your back, staring at the
ceiling, deep in thought? What color are your eyes? Are you short or
tall? What makes you happy and what makes you angry? Do theyallow you to have books? Do they give you the daily paper? What
do you see in your jailer’s eyes? Do you smile often? Do you hear
the birds singing at dawn? Do the army blankets irritate you? Will
peace ever come? Will Oslo bring peace? Is the Likud interested in
peace? Is the Labor party interested in peace?
</p>
<!-- l. 49 --><p class="noindent">Anonymous lieutenant, be your name what it may, sleep well. The
peaceful sleep of a man with a clean conscience. I will soon know
your name, and then I will write you a long letter, a letter from one
prisoner to another. I will open my with ‘Hello, dear’, and end it
with ‘Yours, truly,’
</p>
<!-- l. 51 --><p class="noindent">Imad Saba
</p>
<!-- l. 53 --><p class="noindent">July 13, 1997.
</p>
<!-- l. 55 --><p class="noindent">Imad Sabba was detained on December 12, 1995, with no charges
brought against him, without standing trial, and with no limitations
on  the  length  of  his  arrest.  The  authorities’  claim  against  him
was that he was active with teh Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, a militant Palestinian resistance group, and therefore
posed a threat to regional security. In May 1997, while Saba was in
detention,…B’Tselem reported that 249 Palestinian administrative
detainees were being held in degraded, camp-like conditions, forced
to sleep in tents, and exposed to the elements. Until his arrest, Saba
had been director general of the Bisan Institute for Research and
Development in Ramallah and a lecturer at Bir Zeit University.
</p>
<!-- l. 57 --><p class="noindent">Saba, an intellectual who wrote prolifically from prison about the
likes of Paul Auster and Noam Chomsky, was awarded a graduate
fellowship at a research institute in The Hague. He asked the army
to  release  him  from  administrative  detention  so  he  could  pursue
his studies. His request was denied. Finally, after many months of
negotiation, Saba was released in a deal worked out between his
lawyer and the General Security Services [Shin Bet]. The night of
his release, he was deported to Holland, despite the fact that he was
never charged with a crime.
</p>
<!-- l. 59 --><p class="noindent">…Following his release from military lockup, Yuval Lotem contacted
Imad Saba, and they formed an acquaintanceship that continues to
this day.</p></blockquote>
