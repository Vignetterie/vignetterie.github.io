<li class="enumerate" id="x1-3x1">It  is  2.23  and  I  am  reading  the  Hansard  of  the  third  reading  of  the
Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. This is probably not a very good
idea.

<!-- l. 11 --><p class="noindent">There are only two methods by which governments may seek
to maintain the fighting spirit of a nation in war. There is the
German method, whereby all fact and opinion is disseminated
from one supreme fountainhead. So far that German system has
worked. I don’t think it will work forever. I don’t believe that
the Germans, under their method, could have survived a series
of military disasters such as the British people have survived in
the past two years [applause]. …There is a great deal to be said
for the British way. There is nothing whatsoever to be said for
the amalgation of the [British and German ways]. That was the
French way, and that’s the reason the French went down.</p></blockquote>

<!-- l. 14 --><p class="noindent">[A country can be] left with one of two choices, both suicidal:
either explosion or invasion.</p></blockquote>

<li class="enumerate" id="x1-7x3"><!-- l. 16 --><p class="noindent">On <span class="ec-lmri-10">Panorama</span>, we hear of murders in cold blood, commissioned in our name.
They are related by men of arms: by them, who know what it for a friend to
step on a landmine, to be shot by a Talib in disguise as a civilian,
and to be discarded by a callous political class and people on coming
home. It is difficult to conceive of more credible accusations outside the
courtroom.
</p>
<!-- l. 18 --><p class="noindent">I am no pacifist—facile or otherwise. And I am conscious of my own cowardice
and impotence. I doubt I could kill; and I doubt I could bring myself to kill. Yet
I expect all the conveniences of modern life built on others’ strength of will: to
sleep soundly in my bed, to take a train without fear of detonation, and to
know that these tasks are carried out pursuant to rules that make the price of
the former conscionable.
</p>
<!-- l. 20 --><p class="noindent"><span class="ec-lmri-10">Panorama</span>’s findings evoke a most difficult possibility: that one must choose
either moral or strategic suicide—moral explosion, or external invasion.
Of course, that is a question for the long run. Nobody will invade
tomorrow.</p></li></ol><h2>À propos.</h2>
