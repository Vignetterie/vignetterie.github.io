<h1>Plodwatch I.</h1>
<!-- l. 7 --><p class="noindent">24 July 2022: Drew Pavlou (a rather unpleasant man) is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/23/australian-activist-drew-pavlou-arrested-in-london-but-denies-sending-chinese-embassy-bomb-threat">arrested</a> after the
Chinese embassy sends itself a bomb threat and puts Pavlou’s name on
it.
</p><!-- l. 9 --><p class="indent">   18 May 2025: Peter Tatchell is <a href="https://www.petertatchellfoundation.org/peter-tatchell-arrested-at-palestine-protest-on-fake-charges/">arrested</a> for his sign reading ‘STOP Israel
Genocide! Stop Hamas executions! Odai Al-Rubai, aged 22, executed by Hamas!
RIP!’ and/or shouting ‘Hamas are terrorists’ (which he says he didn’t shout, but of
course there’s nothing wrong with shouting what is, incidentally, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1318/article/2/made">position</a> of His
Majesty’s Government).
</p><!-- l. 11 --><p class="indent">   17 July 2025: A protester holding a Palestinian flag whose signs read ‘Free Gaza’
and ‘Israel is committing genocide’ is threatened with arrest under section 12(1A) of
the Terrorism Act and made to give her details to avoid arrest. It is quite
transparent, in reading the transcript, that the officers concerned have decided that
they must have the details of the person concerned and have them leave, and they
will have to concoct some legal justification for that if necessary. Each of these
justifications is implausible.
</p>
<dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
1. 
</dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">They claim that an offence is being committed under the Terrorism Act.
The officers variously suggest that Murton supported a proscribed group,
did something that ‘come[s] under proscribed groups’ (whatever that
means),  and  ‘express[ed]  an  opinion  or  belief  that  is  supportive  of  a
proscribed organisation’. None of this is true.
</dd>
<dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
2. 
</dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">They also suggest that Murton was distracting traffic, which is supposedly
another offence. (What precisely that offence is is unclear. Presumably any
advertisement is capable of distracting traffic. So too would the gathering
of officers.)
</dd>
<dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
3. 
</dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">And  apparently  the  officers’  cognitive  capacities  sufficed  to  suggest  a
‘public order offence’ might have been committed as well.</dd></dl>
<!-- l. 18 --><p class="noindent">None of these justifications make the slightest bit of sense. Instead of answering
Murton’s perfectly reasonable questions in response to them, they simply resorted to
finding other (poor) excuses, or threatening arrest.
</p><!-- l. 20 --><p class="indent">   Subsequently, Kent Police told <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/25321245.disturbed-mp-hits-armed-police-threaten-gaza-protester/"><span class="ec-lmri-10">The National</span></a> that—</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<!-- l. 22 --><p class="noindent">Following the behaviour of an individual on a traffic roundabout
in  Canterbury  on  Monday,  July  14,  2025,  officers  attended  to
investigate. Having ascertained no offences had been committed, no
further action was taken</p></blockquote>
<!-- l. 25 --><p class="indent">   This is surely inaccurate. The officers state clearly that at least two offences were
committed, in ‘distracting’ traffic, and ‘express[ing] an opinion or belief that is
supportive of a proscribed organisation’.
</p><!-- l. 27 --><p class="indent">   Here is a likely mildly erroneous transcript (mostly copied from YouTube’s)—

<blockquote class="quote">
<!-- l. 29 --><p class="noindent">What’s your intention here today?
</p>
<!-- l. 31 --><p class="noindent">My intention uh is to wave this flag and keep Palestine in the public
consciousness right now.
</p>
<!-- l. 33 --><p class="noindent">So, do you support any proscribed group?
</p>
<!-- l. 35 --><p class="noindent">I do not support any proscribed group.
</p>
<!-- l. 37 --><p class="noindent">Okay.
</p>
<!-- l. 39 --><p class="noindent">I support a free Palestine and the end of genocide.
</p>
<!-- l. 41 --><p class="noindent">Okay. Can I get your details?
</p>
<!-- l. 43 --><p class="noindent">Am I required to give them to you?
</p>
<!-- l. 45 --><p class="noindent">Well, you may be committing [an] offence at the moment. So, I just
need to make sure that you’re legit.
</p>
<!-- l. 47 --><p class="noindent">What offence?
</p>
<!-- l. 49 --><p class="noindent">Well, as you’re aware, obviously [inaudible] an offence to support a
proscribed group [inaudible] Palestine Action.
</p>
<!-- l. 51 --><p class="noindent">Yeah, but I don’t have anything on which says that.
</p>
<!-- l. 53 --><p class="noindent">Appreciate that. But the way you are behaving at the moment would
lead  me  to  believe  that  you  maybe  give  me  suspicion  to  believe
grounds you could be. [sic]
</p>
<!-- l. 55 --><p class="noindent">What suspicion? That I’ve got a sign that says free Gaza? Holding
a Palestinian flag? and I have a sign that says Israel is committing
genocide? Something which is by the way—
</p>
<!-- l. 57 --><p class="noindent">You’re  also  distracting  the  traffic  which  may  cause  an  accident.
That’s also another offence you’re committing.
</p>
<!-- l. 59 --><p class="noindent">Right. Okay.
</p>
<!-- l. 61 --><p class="noindent">So I’ve got a reason to take your name.
</p>
<!-- l. 63 --><p class="noindent">Do I have to give it?</p>
<!-- l. 65 --><p class="noindent">Potentially committing a public order offence as well.
</p>
<!-- l. 67 --><p class="noindent">What do you mean potentially? I don’t understand. Either I am or
I’m not.
</p>
<!-- l. 69 --><p class="noindent">Right,  we  can  go  about  this  two  ways,  right?  My  colleagues
explained that the support of this, mentioning freedom of Gaza,
Israel genocide, all of that all come under proscribed groups which
are terror groups that have been dictated by the government. All
right, which we have suspicions to suggest that you’re supporting
based on your actions here in a city with the flags and the posters
you’ve got.
</p>
<!-- l. 71 --><p class="noindent">Right.
</p>
<!-- l. 73 --><p class="noindent">We to deal with this the best way possible for everyone is to take your
details and have you on your way. All right. If you don’t provide us
with your name and address, those are necessities for us to arrest you
for offences against Terrorism Act for being part of the proscribed
group. So if we can take your name and your address and then you
could be on your way, we can leave it as that and if you go about
something a different day, it’ll be dealt with a different day. But for
today now on this busy roundabout rush hour where we don’t want
an accident to happen, that’s how we want to deal with it is take
your details and leave. Failing that, you may render yourself liable
to arrest in order in order for us to deal with it. Does that make
sense?
</p>
<!-- l. 75 --><p class="noindent">Does that make sense? That makes sense.
</p>
<!-- l. 77 --><p class="noindent">That’s how we want to deal with this. Okay. Because we want to
keep traffic going, not have to leave you in a shell. If we can take your
details, someone will be in touch and they’ll deal with it another
way. Are you happy to give us your details and then be on your way
so that we can deal with it that way?
</p>
<!-- l. 79 --><p class="noindent">On the basis of that, then I will give you those [cut]
</p>
<!-- l. 81 --><p class="noindent">‘Cos you slowed the traffic down, distracting drivers, right? Do this
in the city center.
</p>
<!-- l. 83 --><p class="noindent">If I do this in a city center, are you guys going to come back and tell
me that I’m now potentially committing a terrorist offence? Because
I have the flag of another country again. Have a flag of another
country.
</p>
<!-- l. 85 --><p class="noindent">You have a green flag. Can it just be a flag? You don’t just have a
flag. No, I don’t. I have Free Gaza, and a statement of fact.
</p>
<!-- l. 87 --><p class="noindent">We also have to think about your safety.
</p>
<!-- l. 89 --><p class="noindent">In the middle of the day, plenty of people have been very supportive.
plenty of people don’t go free for your cause.
</p>
<!-- l. 91 --><p class="noindent">I know plenty of people do.</p>
<!-- l. 93 --><p class="noindent">I’m sure there is. But you’re going to come across a person who will
take exception to it.
</p>
<!-- l. 95 --><p class="noindent">[cut]
</p>
<!-- l. 97 --><p class="noindent">So,  I’ll  tell  you  the  offences  that  are  we’ve  been  asked  to  deal
with. So, you’ve got to belong or profess to belong to a proscribed
organization.
</p>
<!-- l. 99 --><p class="noindent">Which I have not.
</p>
<!-- l. 101 --><p class="noindent">It’s a personal [inaudible] and you haven’t. All right.
</p>
<!-- l. 103 --><p class="noindent">And you can’t prove that I do.
</p>
<!-- l. 105 --><p class="noindent">Invite support for a proscribed organization. You haven’t. Express
an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organization.
Now, that you have done.
</p>
<!-- l. 107 --><p class="noindent">Well, that’s ridiculous. You’re going to end up arresting half the
country.
</p>
<!-- l. 109 --><p class="noindent">I didn’t make the legislation. That is the legislation.
</p>
<!-- l. 111 --><p class="noindent">That’s extremely broad.
</p>
<!-- l. 113 --><p class="noindent">[inaudible] your details. And that’s why if we take your details and
we tell you to leave, we’ll tell you not to carry on this down the high
street. The high street is the better place because it’s not a road.
We’re going to tell you not to, take your details and be on our way.
If you’re found down the high street later on, you’ll probably find
yourself arrestable to that fence because you’ve been warned not to.
</p>
<!-- l. 115 --><p class="noindent">So, I can never do this again in Canterbury, in Kent.
</p>
<!-- l. 117 --><p class="noindent">It’s an offence.</p></blockquote>
<!-- l. 120 --><p class="indent">   Some very dim people will construct conspiracy theories, perhaps antisemitic, on
this basis (probably couched in terms of ‘Zionists’ and so on). But the common
pattern in each is that the police unthinkingly go after easy targets. If they want to
find people who support Palestine Action more reliably, they will surely find more in
the larger <span class="ec-lmcsc-10">psc </span>marches—but these tend to be so well-attended that it’s not (to them)
worth the bother (cf when Gideon Falter was stopped from walking through a crowd
because of his kippah). Similarly, when Niyak Ghorbani calls Hamas terrorists at <span class="ec-lmcsc-10">psc</span>
marches, the police <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/metropolitan-police-hamas-is-terrorist-placard-b1144341.html">arrest</a> him, because he’s the easier target. Only when
there is substantial political pressure will they act otherwise (e.g. during the
race riots) and often act with considerable courage, but, of course, such
political pressure can only opaquely be exercised by the Home Secretary,
in the name of ‘operational independence’ (which only really exists when
convenient).
</p><!-- l. 122 --><p class="indent">   In a better world, there would be a substantial segment of public opinion—including
the leaders of the <span class="ec-lmcsc-10">psc</span>—against all these arrests and threatened arrests. But we get the
plods we deserve, and if we can’t build a coalition from Gideon Falter to
the <span class="ec-lmcsc-10">psc </span>demanding a sensible approach to public order policing, it’ll bethe best efforts of such articulate officers as the ones quoted above that’ll
suffice.
