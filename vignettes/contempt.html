Onemight not be entirely happy with the intellectual elegance, or lackthereof, of some of the Uganda opinions. No doubt there are timeswhen a judge might be criticized for having given a party too muchlatitude. But there is sometimes wisdom in issuing messy judgmentsthat  create  a  principle  or  set  a  standard,  on  the  one  hand,  andset aside immediate and drastic action, on the other. Some of theUganda judgments had that character. By letting cases go aheaddespite ambiguous charges while issuing a passport to the defendant,drawing out proceedings until election tempers cooled, allowing aresult to stand while condemning violations of the law, etc., theUgandan courts may have been able to build strength gradually,develop public understasnding and norms, and induce some partsof  the  government  and  opposition  to  trust  their  actions,  even  ifthe  results  were  far  from  perfect  from  the  standpoint  of  justice.Although certain government actions provoked condemnation fromsenior judges, many of the statements were coupled with phrasingdesigned to calm tempers. The Zimbabwe judgments, which wereoften  elegant,  tended  to  be  more  hard-hitting,  and  sharp  publicstatements  by  judges  in  the  years  before  the  clash  may  haveaggravated relationships. Human rights lawyers might disagree withthis assessment, but it is always well to remember that the U.S.Supreme Court issued the murky Marbury in a charged atmosphereand exercised restraint subsequently, gradually building a reservoirof trust.</p></blockquote><dl class="thebibliography"><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-ssemekadde2024"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-1">   <!-- l. 14 --><p class="noindent"><a href="contempt.html" id="X0-"/><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Ssemekadde</span>,Isaac K.<a href="https://x.com/ug_lawsociety/status/1867222639464284398">, <span class="ec-lmri-10">Ahem!
