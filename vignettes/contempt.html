<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>The way in which the judges conducted themselves differed too. One
might not be entirely happy with the intellectual elegance, or lack
thereof, of some of the Uganda opinions. No doubt there are times
when a judge might be criticized for having given a party too much
latitude. But there is sometimes wisdom in issuing messy judgments
that  create  a  principle  or  set  a  standard,  on  the  one  hand,  and
set aside immediate and drastic action, on the other. Some of the
Uganda judgments had that character. By letting cases go ahead
despite ambiguous charges while issuing a passport to the defendant,
drawing out proceedings until election tempers cooled, allowing a
result to stand while condemning violations of the law, etc., the
Ugandan courts may have been able to build strength gradually,



develop public understasnding and norms, and induce some parts
of  the  government  and  opposition  to  trust  their  actions,  even  if
the  results  were  far  from  perfect  from  the  standpoint  of  justice.
Although certain government actions provoked condemnation from
senior judges, many of the statements were coupled with phrasing
designed to calm tempers. The Zimbabwe judgments, which were
often  elegant,  tended  to  be  more  hard-hitting,  and  sharp  public
statements  by  judges  in  the  years  before  the  clash  may  have
aggravated relationships. Human rights lawyers might disagree with
this assessment, but it is always well to remember that the U.S.
Supreme Court issued the murky Marbury in a charged atmosphere
and exercised restraint subsequently, gradually building a reservoir
of trust.</p></blockquote>
