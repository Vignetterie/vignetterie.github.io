      <h1>Rory Stewart in the <em>TLS</em> on Afghanistan and plans.</h1>
      <blockquote class="quote"><!-- l. 8 --><p class="noindent">So  when  Rumsfeld  says  he  has  no  idea  what  the  US  is  doing,or what the mission is, or &#8220;who the bad guys are&#8221;, he does notmean, as Whitlock implies, that nobody has been producing plans orobjectives or analysis. He means that he doesn&#8217;t like what he sees.The same is true when others later say that Rumsfeld himself didnot have a plan. Or when various generals arrive claiming there is noplan, write a detailed plan, and then hand over to a successor whoclaims there is no plan, before writing a detailed plan and handingover to a successor feigning bafflement.</p>     <!-- l. 10 --><p class="noindent">But what if the interviewees and Craig Whitlock are telling youmore about themselves than about Afghanistan? What if there wasindeed  deep  corruption  in  Afghanistan,  but  that  there  were  alsohighly intelligent and dedicated public servants, including PresidentGhani himself? What if there had never been a conscious conspiracyto conceal the problems of Afghanistan? What if the US could havekept 2,500 troops relatively safely and indefinitely in Afghanistan(as it keeps 25,000 troops, seventy years after the cessation of formalconflict, in South Korea)? What if the sunk costs of the interventionwere immense, but the marginal costs of remaining were minimal?What if no magical plan could have existed for Afghanistan but,nevertheless, keeping a very few troops would have saved the countryfrom a Taliban government, protected basic political and civil rights,supported women &#8211; at least in urban areas and much of the ruralCentre  and  North  &#8211;  prevented  the  economy  and  the  health  andeducation systems from collapsing, and kept millions from the edgeof starvation?</p>     <!-- l. 12 --><p class="noindent">What if the US withdrawal was determined not by the &#8220;BloodyBattle in Affghanistan&#8221; but by the &#8220;Grand Contested Election forthe Presidency of the United States&#8221;? What if Afghans were notcowards or incompetents but instead as smart and good as you andme?</p></blockquote>
