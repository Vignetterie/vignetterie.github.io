<!-- l. 8 --><p class='noindent'>So  when  Rumsfeld  says  he  has  no  idea  what  the  US  is  doing,
or what the mission is, or “who the bad guys are”, he does not
mean, as Whitlock implies, that nobody has been producing plans or
objectives or analysis. He means that he doesn’t like what he sees.
The same is true when others later say that Rumsfeld himself did
not have a plan. Or when various generals arrive claiming there is no
plan, write a detailed plan, and then hand over to a successor who
claims there is no plan, before writing a detailed plan and handing
over to a successor feigning bafflement.

<!-- l. 10 --><p class='noindent'>But what if the interviewees and Craig Whitlock are telling you
more about themselves than about Afghanistan? What if there was
indeed  deep  corruption  in  Afghanistan,  but  that  there  were  also
highly intelligent and dedicated public servants, including President
Ghani himself? What if there had never been a conscious conspiracy
to conceal the problems of Afghanistan? What if the US could have
kept 2,500 troops relatively safely and indefinitely in Afghanistan
(as it keeps 25,000 troops, seventy years after the cessation of formal
conflict, in South Korea)? What if the sunk costs of the intervention
were immense, but the marginal costs of remaining were minimal?
What if no magical plan could have existed for Afghanistan but,
nevertheless, keeping a very few troops would have saved the country
from a Taliban government, protected basic political and civil rights,
supported women – at least in urban areas and much of the rural
Centre  and  North  –  prevented  the  economy  and  the  health  and
education systems from collapsing, and kept millions from the edge
of starvation?
</p>     
<!-- l. 12 --><p class='noindent'>What if the US withdrawal was determined not by the “Bloody
Battle in Affghanistan” but by the “Grand Contested Election for
the Presidency of the United States”? What if Afghans were not
cowards or incompetents but instead as smart and good as you and
me?</p></blockquote><dl class='thebibliography'><dt class='thebibliography' id='X0-stewart'>
