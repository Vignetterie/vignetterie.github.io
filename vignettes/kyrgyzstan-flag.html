      <h1>&#8216;Conundrum of visual perception&#8217;</h1>
      <blockquote class="quote"><!-- l. 10 --><p class="noindent">&#8220;There are lot of people who hold the view that the current flaglooks like a sunflower. And because of that, our state has been unableto rise up since it could do nothing but gaze upon the sun,&#8221; [thePresident, Sadyr] Japarov told a journalist[.]</p>     <!-- l. 12 --><p class="noindent">Where the rays in the older design were soft and wavy, they are nowstraight and spiky.</p>     <!-- l. 14 --><p class="noindent">As the word began spreading that somebody might have composeda flag with the wrong number of rays &#8212; and the detail is importantas the number of rays is meant to represent the 40 Kyrgyz tribes &#8212;officials scrambled to limit the damage.</p>     <!-- l. 16 --><p class="noindent">Sure enough, on the night of January 3, Bishkek municipal workerswere filmed lowering the flag and counting the rays up to the requisitenumber.</p>     <!-- l. 18 --><p class="noindent">That has not convinced the doubters, who suspect the wrong flagwas simply substituted for a corrected version under the cover ofnight to enable this piece of choreography.</p>     <!-- l. 20 --><p class="noindent">It  appears  that  subsequent  to  lawmakers  giving  their  blessingto  a  new  flag,  the  government  tinkered  further,  thereby  defyingparliament&#8217;s prerogative to make final decisions on such matters.</p>     <!-- l. 22 --><p class="noindent">This all means at least four &#8212; not to say almost certainly more &#8212;types of Kyrgyz flags in total exist out in the world: the original,parliament&#8217;s version, the government&#8217;s version, and, it appears, adefective 39-rayed variant of the government&#8217;s version.</p>     <!-- l. 24 --><p class="noindent">&#8220;The new flag should have been raised in the presence of a guardof honor. At least in the presence of the secretary of state. Andthe national anthem should have been played. (Only an enemy forcesneaks in and swaps the flag),&#8221; he [Tazabek Ikramov, a lawmaker]wrote on Facebook.</p>     <!-- l. 26 --><p class="noindent">Japarov&#8217;s  team  has  grown  weary  of  all  this.  The  head  ofthe presidential administration, Kanybek Tumanbayev, has calledfor  punishments  for  anybody  spreading  what  he  termed  &#8220;fakeinformation&#8221; about the number of rays on the flag.</p>     <!-- l. 28 --><p class="noindent">Tumanbayev  is  concerned,  among  other  things,  that  continueddiscussions on this topic are going to embarrass Kyrgyzstan.</p>     <!-- l. 30 --><p class="noindent">&#8220;Not only does such false information create discontent among manypeople, but now our Kazakh neighbors are discussing it too,&#8220; hemoaned.</p>     <!-- l. 32 --><p class="noindent">Human  rights  activist  Gulshayir  Abdirasulova  wrote  on  January4 that the State Committee for National Security, or <span class="ec-lmcsc-10">gknb</span>, thesuccessor agency to the <span class="ec-lmcsc-10">kgb</span>, has been summoning people grumblingabout the 39 rays matter for questioning.</p></blockquote>
