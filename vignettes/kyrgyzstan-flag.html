<!-- l. 10 --><p class='noindent'>“There are lot of people who hold the view that the current flag
looks like a sunflower. And because of that, our state has been unable
to rise up since it could do nothing but gaze upon the sun,” [the
President, Sadyr] Japarov told a journalist[.]
</p>     
<!-- l. 12 --><p class='noindent'>Where the rays in the older design were soft and wavy, they are now
straight and spiky.
</p>     
<!-- l. 14 --><p class='noindent'>As the word began spreading that somebody might have composed
a flag with the wrong number of rays — and the detail is important
as the number of rays is meant to represent the 40 Kyrgyz tribes —
officials scrambled to limit the damage.
</p>     
<!-- l. 16 --><p class='noindent'>Sure enough, on the night of January 3, Bishkek municipal workers
were filmed lowering the flag and counting the rays up to the requisite
number.
</p>     
<!-- l. 18 --><p class='noindent'>That has not convinced the doubters, who suspect the wrong flag
was simply substituted for a corrected version under the cover of
night to enable this piece of choreography.
</p>     
<!-- l. 20 --><p class='noindent'>It  appears  that  subsequent  to  lawmakers  giving  their  blessing
to  a  new  flag,  the  government  tinkered  further,  thereby  defying
parliament’s prerogative to make final decisions on such matters.
</p>     
<!-- l. 22 --><p class='noindent'>This all means at least four — not to say almost certainly more —
types of Kyrgyz flags in total exist out in the world: the original,
parliament’s version, the government’s version, and, it appears, a
defective 39-rayed variant of the government’s version.
</p>     
<!-- l. 24 --><p class='noindent'>“The new flag should have been raised in the presence of a guard
of honor. At least in the presence of the secretary of state. And
the national anthem should have been played. (Only an enemy force
sneaks in and swaps the flag),” he [Tazabek Ikramov, a lawmaker]
wrote on Facebook.
</p>     
<!-- l. 26 --><p class='noindent'>Japarov’s  team  has  grown  weary  of  all  this.  The  head  of
the presidential administration, Kanybek Tumanbayev, has called
for  punishments  for  anybody  spreading  what  he  termed  “fake
information” about the number of rays on the flag.
</p>     
<!-- l. 28 --><p class='noindent'>Tumanbayev  is  concerned,  among  other  things,  that  continued
discussions on this topic are going to embarrass Kyrgyzstan.
</p>     
<!-- l. 30 --><p class='noindent'>“Not only does such false information create discontent among many
people, but now our Kazakh neighbors are discussing it too,“ he
moaned.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p>     
<!-- l. 32 --><p class='noindent'>Human  rights  activist  Gulshayir  Abdirasulova  wrote  on  January
4 that the State Committee for National Security, or <span class='ec-lmcsc-10'>gknb</span>, the
successor agency to the <span class='ec-lmcsc-10'>kgb</span>, has been summoning people grumbling
about the 39 rays matter for questioning.</p></blockquote>
