    <main><h1>A salmon recipe.</h1><!-- l. 7 --><p class="noindent">Ingredients: olive oil and/or butter, anchovies, garlic, chilli, herbs to taste,salmon (I find 250 grammes per person sufficient), tomatoes&#8212;mix of largeand cherry (I find 150 grammes total per person sufficient), stock (fish orvegetable, anywhere from 150 to 400 ml per person is fine, reduction timewill vary). Put a dutch oven on medium heat on a stove, pre-heat the ovento about 160C fan, roughly cut the garlic and finely the chilli, and halvethe cherry tomatoes, roughly chop the larger ones leaving some fairly largechunks. Soften the garlic, chilli, and anchovies in the oil and butter for fiveminutes. Then throw in the tomatoes and soften for ten. Pour in the stock andsubmerge the salmon for ten to twenty minutes. Whether to leave the lid ondepends on how much stock you put in&#8212;I usually leave it on. Then left thesalmon on top of the tomatoes so the skin is exposed and turn the oven togrill for another ten or twenty minutes, removing the salmon if it is toocrisped. The salmon goes well with flatbread or pasta. In the case of pasta, alittle less reduction is necessary, and the sauce can be tossed in some of thetomato sauce spooned out. One considerable advantage of this recipe is thatthe salmon overcooks very slowly, because it is immersed in the tomato.One can also make small incisions in the meat to encourage the sauce to fillit.</p>   <h2>&#192; propos.</h2><h3>&#201;tiquettes.</h3><p><a href="../etiquettes/recettes.html">recettes<span class="nowidth">.</span></a></p><h3>Mises &#224; jour.</h3><p>J.P.
