                <h1>A salmon recipe.</h1>

<!-- l. 7 --><p class='noindent'>Ingredients: olive oil and/or butter, anchovies, garlic, chilli, herbs to taste,
salmon (I find 250 grammes per person sufficient), tomatoes—mix of large
and cherry (I find 150 grammes total per person sufficient), stock (fish or
vegetable, anywhere from 150 to 400 ml per person is fine, reduction time
will vary). Put a dutch oven on medium heat on a stove, pre-heat the oven



to about 160C fan, roughly cut the garlic and finely the chilli, and halve
the cherry tomatoes, roughly chop the larger ones leaving some fairly large
chunks. Soften the garlic, chilli, and anchovies in the oil and butter for five
minutes. Then throw in the tomatoes and soften for ten. Pour in the stock and
submerge the salmon for ten to twenty minutes. Whether to leave the lid on
depends on how much stock you put in—I usually leave it on. Then left the
salmon on top of the tomatoes so the skin is exposed and turn the oven to
grill for another ten or twenty minutes, removing the salmon if it is too
crisped. The salmon goes well with flatbread or pasta. In the case of pasta, a
little less reduction is necessary, and the sauce can be tossed in some of the
tomato sauce spooned out. One considerable advantage of this recipe is that
the salmon overcooks very slowly, because it is immersed in the tomato.
One can also make small incisions in the meat to encourage the sauce to fill
it.
