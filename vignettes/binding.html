                <h1>A letter on binding.</h1>

<!-- l. 7 --><p class='noindent'>The original read thus.

<blockquote class='quote'>
<!-- l. 9 --><p class='noindent'>Robin Kinross modestly omits to mention that he himself has had
‘books printed and bound elsewhere…by firms that still understand
the  workings  of  paper  and  glue’,  so  I  hope  you  will  forgive  the
unprompted  advertisement  for  Hyphen  Press  (<a id='x1-2'></a><a id='page.2'></a><a href='binding.html#X0-2024i'>“Letters”</a>).  Alas,
neither British printers nor large publishers have been shamed into
following his example. So what can be done?
</p>     
<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>Nearly   two   decades   ago,   Frank   <a id='x1-3'></a><a href='binding.html#X0-kermode2007'><span class='ec-lmcsc-10'>Kermode</span></a>  [in   these   pages]
complained  about  poor  binding,  and  Kinross  pointed  out  the
problem with hot-melt (<a id='x1-4'></a><a href='binding.html#X0-2007a'>“Letters”</a>). But even if reviewers were to
complain in each case, readers would have to withhold their custom
to create more than a marginal market for properly bound books.
</p>     
<!-- l. 13 --><p class='noindent'>Consortia  of  academic  libraries,  on  the  other  hand,  have  power
to  jointly  withhold  custom  and  large  budgets;  they  have  forced
concessions  on  open  access  and  publishing  fees.  But  they  seem
content to buy even reference works that are barely usable when new
and will be difficult to repair after heavy use.
</p>     
<!-- l. 15 --><p class='noindent'>Durably bound books comprise multiple ‘sections’ of sheets folded
in half, sewn together and cold glued. Unless the thread fails, a
page would have to be torn completely to fall out. When a book
is damaged, the thread can be removed, individual pages repaired,
and sections resewn. (Hot-melt is difficult to remove from sections



without tearing the paper.) Many old books in university libraries
will have been rebound thus several times.
</p>     
<!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>I have on my desk a copy of <span class='ec-lmri-10'>Oxford Handbook of Hume </span>from the
Bodleian. It is a ‘perfect’ binding: the pages are simply stacked on
top of each other and glued together at the back, and fall out easily
when the glue fails; it is difficult to reattach them properly. The glue
of course is hot-melt; it is only because the book is so thick that it
will lie flat (and only in the middle pages). It is £157.50 new.</p></blockquote>
<!-- l. 20 --><p class='indent'>   I should add that readers also command some institutional organisation, and that
we too therefore share part of the blame. I am not aware of a single discussion in a
library committee in which the quality of bindings was raised. Indeed, even the
prospect of raising such a matter or proposing to take any action of the sort I
propose above would seem fogeyish. (I should be happy to be corrected.) For this, we
get the glue we deserve.
