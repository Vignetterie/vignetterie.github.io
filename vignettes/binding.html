    <main><h1>A letter on binding.</h1><!-- l. 7 --><p class="noindent">The original read thus.</p>     <blockquote class="quote"><!-- l. 9 --><p class="noindent">Robin Kinross modestly omits to mention that he himself has had&#8216;books printed and bound elsewhere&#8230;by firms that still understandthe  workings  of  paper  and  glue&#8217;,  so  I  hope  you  will  forgive  theunprompted  advertisement  for  Hyphen  Press  (<a id="x1-2"/><a id="page.3"/><a href="binding.html#X0-2024h">&#8216;Letters&#8217;</a>).  Alas,neither British printers nor large publishers have been shamed intofollowing his example. So what can be done?</p>     <!-- l. 11 --><p class="noindent">Nearly   two   decades   ago,   Frank   <a id="x1-3"/><a href="binding.html#X0-kermode2007"><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Kermode</span></a>  [in   these   pages]complained  about  poor  binding,  and  Kinross  pointed  out  theproblem with hot-melt (<a id="x1-4"/><a href="binding.html#X0-2007a">&#8216;Letters&#8217;</a>). But even if reviewers were tocomplain in each case, readers would have to withhold their customto create more than a marginal market for properly bound books.</p>     <!-- l. 13 --><p class="noindent">Consortia  of  academic  libraries,  on  the  other  hand,  have  powerto  jointly  withhold  custom  and  large  budgets;  they  have  forcedconcessions  on  open  access  and  publishing  fees.  But  they  seemcontent to buy even reference works that are barely usable when newand will be difficult to repair after heavy use.</p>     <!-- l. 15 --><p class="noindent">Durably bound books comprise multiple &#8216;sections&#8217; of sheets foldedin half, sewn together and cold glued. Unless the thread fails, apage would have to be torn completely to fall out. When a bookis damaged, the thread can be removed, individual pages repaired,and sections resewn. (Hot-melt is difficult to remove from sectionswithout tearing the paper.) Many old books in university librarieswill have been rebound thus several times.</p>     <!-- l. 17 --><p class="noindent">I have on my desk a copy of <span class="ec-lmri-10">Oxford Handbook of Hume </span>from theBodleian. It is a &#8216;perfect&#8217; binding: the pages are simply stacked ontop of each other and glued together at the back, and fall out easilywhen the glue fails; it is difficult to reattach them properly. The glueof course is hot-melt; it is only because the book is so thick that itwill lie flat (and only in the middle pages). It is &#163;157.50 new.</p></blockquote><!-- l. 20 --><p class="indent">   I should add that readers also command some institutional organisation, and thatwe too therefore share part of the blame. I am not aware of a single discussion in alibrary committee in which the quality of bindings was raised. Indeed, even theprospect of raising such a matter or proposing to take any action of the sort Ipropose above would seem fogeyish. (I should be happy to be corrected.) For this, weget the glue we deserve.</p>   <dl class="thebibliography"><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-kermode2007"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-1">   <!-- l. 23 --><p class="noindent"><a href="binding.html" id="X0-"/><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Kermode</span>, Frank<a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v29/n13/frank-kermode/nothing-for-ever-and-ever">, &#8216;Nothing for Ever and Ever&#8217;<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <span class="ec-lmri-10">London Review of Books</span>29.13 (2007).</p>   </dd><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-2007a"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-2">   <!-- l. 23 --><p class="noindent"><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v29/n15/letters">&#8216;Letters&#8217;<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <span class="ec-lmri-10">London Review of Books </span>29.15 (2007).</p>   </dd><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-2024h"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-3">   <!-- l. 23 --><p class="noindent"><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n24/letters">&#8216;Letters&#8217;<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <span class="ec-lmri-10">London Review of Books </span>46.24 (2024).</p></dd></dl><h2>&#192; propos.</h2><h3>&#201;tiquettes.</h3><p><a href="../etiquettes/london-review-of-books.html">London Review of Books<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/bookbinding.html">bookbinding<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/libraries.html">libraries<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/printing.html">printing<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/hyphen-press.html">Hyphen Press<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/hume.html">Hume<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/oxford.html">Oxford<span class="nowidth">.</span></a></p><h3>Mises &#224; jour.</h3><p>J.P.
