<h1>On Paul Mashatile.</h1>
<blockquote class="quote">
<!-- l. 8 --><p class="noindent">The  two  most  noteworthy  things  that  have  involved  Mashatile
during this period have both been negative. First, there was the
“assassination attempt” on the DP in April, during which his car
was allegedly shot at – an incident shrouded in mystery because
it  appears  that  almost  nobody  in  the  ANC  believes  it  actually
happened, with the conspiracy theory there being that Mashatile
was hoping for a Donald Trump-style post-assassination popularity
surge. If so, it didn’t work; one of the only groups to express real
concern was the EFF leadership, which is so strange in itself that it
greatly fortified theories that a Mashatile presidency would see the
EFF elevated to hitherto unrealised heights of political power.</p></blockquote>
