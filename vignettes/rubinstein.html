<!-- l. 7 --><p class='noindent'>…on ‘the catastrophe, after which everything will, probably, be different’
(<a id='x1-2'></a><span class='ec-lmcsc-10'>Rubinstein</span>, <a id='page.2'></a><a href='rubinstein.html#X0-rubinstein2015a'>“Our lot is not with them”</a>).

<!-- l. 9 --><p class='noindent'>The flagship issues for the relgious-Zionist camp are unity of the
people and unity of the land. They are getting all of the land via
the settlements and the occupation. And they’re getting all of the
people for free because most of us are addicted to the mantras and
refrain from speaking the truth: almost a half-century of occupation
and settlement is separating us, the “faithful of the Jewish people”,
from them, the “faithful of the Land of Israel.”
</p>     
<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>Our lot is not with them. There is no place for false groveling or
shows of reconciliation. This false unity is enabling the settlers to
achieve all their goals. Instead of searching for common ground, we
should be declaring our glaring differences. The Israeli right also
only understands credible threats. The religious-Zionist public will



be compelled to reexamine its positions if it is made to understand
that spiritual redemption is not around the corner, and that fealty
of the land is going to shatter the unity of the people.
</p>     
<!-- l. 13 --><p class='noindent'>And if this last force is of no help, all that will be left to do (for
me, at least) is to stay here, watch with horror the oppression of
the Palestinians, watch as a society whose values I don’t respect
takes shape and await—with trepidation—the catastrophe, after which
everything will, probably, be different.</p></blockquote>

<!-- l. 18 --><p class='noindent'>These young people are here simply because this is their home and
in any other place they would feel that they do not belong. They are
here not because of the tax benefits but because of the familiar brand
of instant coffee. They are here because they are actually dying to
do reserve duty, even if only to have the opportunity to refuse to
serve in the territories.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class='quote'>
<!-- l. 23 --><p class='noindent'>Here in Israel, this is the season for commissions of inquiry. And I
feel the need to appoint an internal commission of inquiry. On this
committee, there will be one member (me), one witness (me) and
one person under scrutiny (me). The committee will focus on the
question: How did I ever become an enthusiastic supporter of Amir
Peretz, the Labour Party leader, during Israel’s election campaign
earlier this year?</p></blockquote>
