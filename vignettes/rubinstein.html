They are getting all of the land viathe settlements and the occupation. And they&#8217;re getting all of thepeople for free because most of us are addicted to the mantras andrefrain from speaking the truth: almost a half-century of occupationand settlement is separating us, the &#8220;faithful of the Jewish people&#8221;,from them, the &#8220;faithful of the Land of Israel.&#8221;</p>     <!-- l. 11 --><p class="noindent">Our lot is not with them. There is no place for false groveling orshows of reconciliation. This false unity is enabling the settlers toachieve all their goals. Instead of searching for common ground, weshould be declaring our glaring differences. The Israeli right alsoonly understands credible threats. The religious-Zionist public willbe compelled to reexamine its positions if it is made to understandthat spiritual redemption is not around the corner, and that fealtyof the land is going to shatter the unity of the people.</p>     <!-- l. 13 --><p class="noindent">And if this last force is of no help, all that will be left to do (forme, at least) is to stay here, watch with horror the oppression ofthe Palestinians, watch as a society whose values I don&#8217;t respecttakes shape and await&#8212;with trepidation&#8212;the catastrophe, after whicheverything will, probably, be different.</p></blockquote><!-- l. 16 --><p class="indent">   &#8230;on &#8216;correct Zionist action&#8217; (<a id="x1-3"/><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Rubinstein</span>, <a href="rubinstein.html#X0-rubinstein2010"><span class="ec-lmri-10">Remarks at the 2010 Rothschild PrizAward Ceremony</span></a>).</p>     <blockquote class="quote"><!-- l. 18 --><p class="noindent">These young people are here simply because this is their home andin any other place they would feel that they do not belong. They arehere not because of the tax benefits but because of the familiar brandof instant coffee. They are here because they are actually dying todo reserve duty, even if only to have the opportunity to refuse toserve in the territories.</p></blockquote><!-- l. 21 --><p class="indent">   &#8230;on an &#8216;internal commission of inquiry&#8217; (<a id="x1-4"/><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Rubinstein</span>, <a href="rubinstein.html#X0-rubinstein2006">&#8216;Why was I somistaken&#8217;</a>).</p>     <blockquote class="quote"><!-- l. 23 --><p class="noindent">Here in Israel, this is the season for commissions of inquiry. And Ifeel the need to appoint an internal commission of inquiry. On thiscommittee, there will be one member (me), one witness (me) andone person under scrutiny (me). The committee will focus on thequestion: How did I ever become an enthusiastic supporter of AmirPeretz, the Labour Party leader, during Israel&#8217;s election campaignearlier this year?</p></blockquote><dl class="thebibliography"><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-rubinstein2010"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-1">   <!-- l. 25 --><p class="noindent"><a id="page.4"/><a href="rubinstein.html" id="X0-"/><span class="ec-lmcsc-10">Rubinstein</span>, Ariel<a href="https://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/articles/YadHanadiv_20101015.pdf">, <span class="ec-lmri-10">Remarks at the 2010 Rothschild Priz Award Ceremony</span><span class="postitalicnowidth">,</span></a>2010.</p>   </dd><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-rubinstein2006"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-2">   <!-- l. 25 --><p class="noindent">&#8212;   <a href="https://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/articles/jcDotCom_082506.htm">&#8216;Why was I so mistaken&#8217;<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <span class="ec-lmri-10">Jewish Chronicle </span>(24th&#160;Aug. 2006).</p>   </dd><dt class="thebibliography" id="X0-rubinstein2015a"/><dd class="thebibliography" id="bib-3">   <!-- l. 25 --><p class="noindent">&#8212;   <a href="https://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/articles/haaretz_111315_eng.pdf">&#8216;Our  lot  is  not  with  them&#8217;<span class="nowidth">,</span></a>  <span class="ec-lmri-10">Haaretz  </span>Israel  Conference  on  Peace(2015),&#160;88&#8211;9.</p></dd></dl><h2>&#192; propos.</h2><h3>&#201;tiquettes.</h3><p><a href="../etiquettes/israel.html">Israel<span class="nowidth">,</span></a> <a href="../etiquettes/ariel-rubinstein.html">Ariel Rubinstein<span class="nowidth">.</span></a></p><h3>Mises &#224; jour.</h3><p>J.P.
